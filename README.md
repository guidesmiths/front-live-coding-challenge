## üíª Live coding tasks

With your teammates‚Äô help, you must complete the tasks given to the highest possible quality, always following the Team Agreements:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1Ô∏è‚É£ Try to execute the code locally and verify that it runs correctly. If not, try to solve any bugs you find until the app works as expected.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the `unit tests` and verify that they run correctly. Otherwise, try to fix the bugs you find until the tests pass.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the `integration tests` and verify that they run correctly. If not, try to solve any bugs you may find until the tests pass.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4Ô∏è‚É£ Include the possibility to `remove a telephone from the catalogue view`, as well as the tests that check if the functionality is working correctly.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5Ô∏è‚É£ Add the `detailed view of the phones`, as well as the tests that check if the functionality is working correctly.
